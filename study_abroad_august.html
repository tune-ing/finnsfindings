    <h2>Study Abroad — Week 1 (ish) Reflection</h2>

    <h3>Overview of August 17 - August 27, 2025</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Main theme of the week: keep trying new things </li>
      <li>Biggest highlight: saw two operas and made friends through others</li>
      <li>Biggest challenge: navigating my assumptions about other americans</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>More detailed thoughts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Copenhagen Opera Festival: Attended two performances. First was an abbreviated version of Carmen by Bizet. That had an amazing conductor. The second was a story about if Jesus was a woman and made me really think about the world which was cool. Also at this cool young hip venue where I could see myself in ten years in the audience members. ;</li>
      <li>A LOT of WALKING — Toured Norrebro, walked around the lakes, saw a double rainbow on my path to pick up a too good to go from Lagkahuset.</li>
      <li>Mixed frisbee practice with Hucks. I love frisbee and the community. Everyone's so willing to learn and teach in a mostly kind way. But I do enjoy mixed more as I feel that there are more chances taken and less precison which slows the game.;</li>
      <li>Nightlife: went to Proud Mary's on a Tuesday for "American Night". Not my scence, take your frat party and add more BO, a professional bar, and more tables to dance on, but I'm glad I saw what it was.</li>
      <li>Explored the canals. Organized new friends to take out a GoBoat and cruised on the canals while sipping fruit wine, eating cheese, and making dumb jokes. It was a blast! </li>
      <li>Class. I'm enjoying all of my classes so far, and currently I like my Anthropology of Food class the best because we got to eat! and the professor is quite "bitchy and opinionated" (his words, not mine). </li>
    </ul>
