    <h2>Reflection on my friendship and community so far
        <h3>Lower your expectations or have none.</h3>
    </h2>
    

  <p>Recently, I‚Äôve been disappointed in my own life; both from talking with friends and also from other DIS students posting with their #new besties!! ‚ô•Ô∏è in a dark room illuminated by a disco ball, or jumping into the water from the stairs by Island Brygge, or a blurry but clearly joyous photo dump of ‚Äúthe dreams she didn‚Äôt know existed in Copenhagen‚Äù on Instagram. It‚Äôs made me question how I am spending my time, alone.</p>

  <p>I tried to reach out the first few weeks, but I was tired from moving around the world and I naively thought that friends would come easy. All the bloggers (both DIS and personal YouTube, Tiktok, Instagram) said to not worry. But I think I should have worried at least a little bit. And perhaps I was a little arrogant from the summer where in just a few weeks I had made good friends both in and outside my research program. It was easy this summer, and I just don‚Äôt know why it hasn‚Äôt been now.</p>

  <p>And perhaps I should give myself my credit. I have done the ‚Äúfriend‚Äù things with people. I‚Äôve made & gotten dinner with them, danced, sang poor karaoke, cheered, talked for hours, explored the city, played frisbee, complained about our academically rigorous schools and how we miss everyone caring about their futures, and studied (because academics are still a thing even if the workload is lighter) together.</p>

  <p>But no one has stuck yet.</p>

  <p>Listing everything out, that does sound like friends, so what am I missing? Do I want to go on trips with these people? Maybe. Do I want to hang out with them more? Yes. How much more do I want to feel the rush of friendship? A lot more. A #instagramable amount more.</p>

  <p>While we could deep dive into why I care (so much, too much) about Instagram, I‚Äôll simply say that I don‚Äôt want the world (the 1200 ppl who follow me, or rather the 200 ppl who engage with my stuff) to know that I am not #livingmybestlife. I know that of course none of us are, and Instagram isn‚Äôt a full reflection of reality, but when people post, or reflect on how they loved study abroad, or even worse say that they regret not studying abroad. I feel that I am squandering this opportunity.</p>

  <p>I want to blame my housing for making me feel so isolated and friendless. There‚Äôs a weird cost to convenience and population. In the biggest Kollegium with great amenities (laundry, gym, courtyard, coffeehouse) and proximity to a great train station, I somehow still feel isolated from people. I live in a dorm styled where I have my own room and bathroom, and a shared kitchen that doesn‚Äôt feel communal. Unlike other Kollegiums where it is more like an apartment shared between 3‚Äì6 people. And while that doesn‚Äôt guarantee community. It would help in the first few weeks especially if there are Danish students living there.</p>

  <p>My housing placement felt like a slap in the face that they didn‚Äôt have anywhere better to place me.</p>

  <p>But I feel ungrateful and guilty that I have all of these resources at my fingertips and I am not #livingmybestlife.</p>

  <p>I know (despite the cliche) that I‚Äôm the only one to blame, blah blah blah. And I need to set goals to turn my frown upside down. üôÇüò°</p>

  <p>But lastly, before I get into my plan, I need to remind myself that comparison is the thief of joy. Back home, I leave the campus center and on my five minute walk home I will see 5‚Äì10 people I know and wave to them and maybe chat. Or I‚Äôve learned that I can‚Äôt study in the dining hall during the day because I will get distracted every few minutes by a friend passing by. Through talking with friends, I‚Äôve realized that I know and am friends with many more people than my friends (on average) are (though of course by the paradox of friendship some of them are even more connected). In comparison, I wave to one person (if I‚Äôm lucky!) on my walk between classes, and I only see other people studying every so often. I will take initiative and sit with these people, but it is not the same volume that I get back on my home campus.</p>

  <p>I think I was so determined to make non Wellesley friends on my own that I abandoned the one safety net I had. But even not really, because I wasn‚Äôt friends with most of them before. But now I can be and now I will be using them as a spring board to make other non Wellesley friends.</p>

  <p>For my many acquaintances, I will reach out to them this week and after the Long Study Tour, to spend time together. There are many group chats I‚Äôm in that have an original purpose (cheffing up dinner, board games, etc.) that I will ask if people want to engage again. Lastly, I will try to stay off Instagram. Mainly I like it because I get to keep up with my friends at home (like San Francisco, and now Wellesley) or to reach out to people whose numbers I don‚Äôt have yet, but it is directly making me sad. So it (scrolling) is not worth it for now.</p>

  <p>The plan is going to take energy. But it will be worth it to (1) not feel so sad (2) to hopefully!! have the joy that I am looking for and was excited for in this program. I believe it is still possible and the one thing about making friends now is that hopefully when I join the friend groups, people are vetted and there is more time for fun.</p>
